                <p>
                    Tickle D. Frickle is a simple <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Xenodermus#:
                    ~:text=Xenodermus%20javanicus%2C%20also%20known%20as,to%20the%
                    20monotypic%20genus%20Xenodermus.">King Dragon Snake</a>
                    from humble beginnings.  He is likely of East Asian descent, but hatched and grew up in the Abilene Texas area.
                    While completing his doctorate and law degree, he pursued other interests including business, accounting, physics, flight training, aerospace engineering, 
                    and philosophy. 
                    When he wasn't busy helping himself, it was possible you'd find him helping someone else.
                    He now faces his most important challenge yet: getting your vote and making this place the best place!
