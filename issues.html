                    And there is one problem in particular - the problem 
                    of a lizard named Gus. I have been informed that this Gus has been causing 
                    trouble in maner of our neighborhoods. 
                    He has been eating up Schbears' garden, scaring little children, 
                    bein loud, and generally making a nuisance of himself. 
                    But do not fear, my fellow fryends. I promise you that I 
                    will personaly take care of this menace 
                    Gus and make sure that he never causes any more trouble again. 
                    I will track him down, apprehend him, 
                    and bring him to justice. Under my leadershipp, no lisard will 
                    ever threaten us again! Especialy not one as dumb as Gus."
